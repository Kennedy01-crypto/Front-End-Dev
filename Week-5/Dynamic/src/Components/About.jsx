      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Founded in 1998, Green Haven Wildlife Sanctuary began as a small rescue
        center for injured and orphaned animals. Over the years, we have grown
        into a leading sanctuary dedicated to the protection and rehabilitation
        of wildlife, as well as fostering a deeper connection between people and
        nature.
